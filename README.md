# Statistics
A program that outputs some basic infos about statistics based on your input

Just execute **Statistics.py** and enter the numbers or the words from your survey and the program will output a 2-dimentional table with v, N, f, f%, F, F% columns.

**Simple and Fast Command-line application.**

P.S: 1) Some Statistic knowledge is required!
     2) **texttable.py is needed...** The program will **NOT** run if this file is not on the same folder
